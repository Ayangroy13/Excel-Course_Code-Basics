### Course Work
### Day 1:

• Excel building blocks include sheets, cells, rows, columns, the ribbon menu, and the formula bar.

• An Excel workbook is saved with the extension '.xlsx'.

• The most commonly used operations in Excel are filtering, sorting, and conditional formatting.

• For writing formula in a cell start with "=" sign Use Format painter tool, to copy paste formats

• Formulas covered - SUM(), AVERAGE(), IF(), SUMIF()

• Locking referenced cells in a formula helps prevent dynamic changes when the formula is copied or moved to another cell.

• To lock a column or row reference, put a '$' in front of it. You can also use the F4 key to do the same.

• You have the flexibility to lock either rows or columns or both.

• Named Ranges allow calculations using descriptive names rather than cell references.

• Formulas will be automatically applied to new rows.

• Additional features such as slicers, automatic totals, and filters are available.

• Table headers remain visible when scrolling down, which is useful for large tables.

• The "Recommended Charts" feature in Excel suggests the most appropriate charts based on the selected data.

• Converting data into tables allows the automatic addition of new data to charts.

• The UNIQUE() function extracts unique values from a range or array.

Merge & Center option combines multiple cells into one cell and centers the content horizontally within the merged cell.

Format Painter quickly copies and applies cell formatting to other cells or ranges in

your spreadsheet.

• Format Cells dialog box helps you to customize cell appearance and behavior in your spreadsheet.

Wrap text lets you display the cell contents over multiple lines instead of one.

• Excel provides several security features to help protect your spreadsheet from unauthorized access or modification.

### Day 2:

• Data cleaning is an important step in the data analysis process because it ensures that the data is accurate and reliable.

• The TRIM() function eliminates extra spaces in the text, including those at the start and end.

• Conditional Formatting helps to identify and highlight duplicate data in a range of cells.

• The "Text to Columns" feature helps to split a single cell containing text into multiple cells based on a specified delimiter, such as a comma, semicolon, or space.

• VLOOKUP function is used to look up a value in a table by searching for a corresponding value in the leftmost column of another table.

• Syntax of the VLOOKUP() function is: VLOOKUP (lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])

• Some limitations of VLookup:

- It searches only the first column of a reference table for a matching value.

Adding a new column to the reference table can cause errors by shifting column indexes and changing the referenced columns.

• INDEX() and MATCH() are two powerful Excel functions that are often used together to search for and retrieve data from a table or range.

• The syntax of the INDEX() function is: INDEX(array, row_num, [column_num]).

• The syntax of the MATCH() function is: MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_type]).

• The syntax of the XLOOKUP() function is: XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, [if_not_found], [match_mode]).

• Unlike VLOOKUP, which only searches in the leftmost column of a table, XLOOKUP is capable of searching in any column.

### Day 3:

• Business Knowledge + Business Math & Statistics = KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

• Formulas covered: IF, SUM, SUMIF, COUNT, COUNTIF, AVERAGE

• Null values can be handled in different ways based on the business situation:

• Delete that data

• Replace with the mean or median value

• Revenue - Budget = Profit/Loss

• Budget is the baseline for calculating the Profit/Loss percentage.

• Market Value: Total revenue of all the movies.

• Market Share: The revenue contribution of a particular industry to the overall market value.

• Target: Estimated revenue for a particular time period.

• Use conditional formatting to highlight values that are above or below a certain threshold.

• With 20% of statistics, you can cover 80% of your work.

• Mean - Synonym for Average.

• Median - Middle value of a dataset when it is ordered in ascending order.

• If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.

• Mode - Most frequently occurring data value.

• Variance is a measure of how spread out a distribution is. It is calculated as the

average of the squared differences from the mean.

• The smaller the variance, the less spread out the data is. Conversely, the larger the variance, the more spread out the data is.

• Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. It is calculated as the square root of the variance.

• The smaller the standard deviation, the closer the data points are to the mean. Conversely, the larger the standard deviation, the more spread out the data points are.

• The stock market's volatility is the best use case for variance and standard deviation.

• Correlation is a statistical measure that shows the degree to which two variables are related.

• A correlation coefficient can range from -1 to 1

4-1 (perfect negative correlation) < 0 (no correlation) <1 (perfect positive correlation)

### Day 4:

• As a Data Analyst, it may be difficult to survive without Pivot tables.

• You can insert a Pivot table either in the same worksheet or in a new worksheet.

• Pivot tables make it easy to summarize data.

• Pivot tables allow you to slice and dice data in any format you want.

• To create a pivot table, follow these steps: Insert > Pivot Table > Select the table/range > Create Pivot Table

• You can use the recommended pivot table for several use cases. Make sure to explore all other options available in the pivot table.

• Power Pivot is a data modeling tool for Microsoft Excel. It allows users to create relationships between tables and perform advanced calculations with large amounts of data.

• To create measures, we can use the DAX (Data Analysis Expression) language.

• Primary key: It is a column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. Foreign key: It is a column or combination of columns that refers to the primary key of another table and establishes a link between the two tables.

• Don't become obsessed with tools; instead, develop a problem-solving mindset to experience exponential growth in your career.

• Break down complex problems into small chunks to solve them effectively.

• Use the SUMX([table], [expression]) function to add up the values in a table based on a specified expression.

• In accounting, negative values are represented using brackets.

• To highlight interesting data points, use conditional formatting.

• Pivot tables allow you to sort data based on different values.

• You can make pivot tables more presentable by using formatting and other options. - Pivot tables are very similar to the matrix visualizations that you will use in Bi tools.

### Day 5:

• ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It refers to the process of extracting data from various sources, transforming the data to fit the desired data model or format, and loading the data into a target data store or destination.

• Power Query transforms and connects data from different sources, such as databases and spreadsheets, into a format suitable for analysis and reporting.

✓ Ensure there are no missing values

✓ Ensure all dimension tables contain a unique column

✓ Ensure there are no errors / #na in column

✓ Check spellings randomly

• Data cleaning in Power Query involves the process of identifying and correcting inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and errors in data to ensure that it is accurate and usable for analysis and reporting. 

• Giving proper names to Power Query steps can make your queries more organized and easier to understand. Data modeling involves the process of connecting different data sets together by establishing the relationships between them.

• The Star schema is a data modeling technique that arranges data into a central fact table, surrounded by several dimension tables.

• Google and ChatGPT are your friends. Refer to them whenever you encounter any challenges.

• A Calendar Year is a 12-month period starting on January 1st and ending on December 31st.

• P&L statements include several critical metrics, such as Net Sales, Cost Of Goods Sold (COGS), Gross Margin, Gross Margin %, etc. These metrics evaluate a company's financial performance, profitability, and pricing tactics.

• The FORMAT function is used to format a number or a date/time value into a specific format. The syntax for the FORMAT() function is: FORMAT(value, format_text)

• The MONTH() function is a date and time function used to extract the month number from a date.

• The ROUNDUP() function is used to round a number up to a specified number of digits. The syntax for the ROUNDUP() function is: ROUNDUP(number, num_digits)
